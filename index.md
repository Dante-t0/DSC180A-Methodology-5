### Question 1
**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic that we covered this quarter to me is the semantic smoothing of LLMs. I find it interesting how carefully constructed jailbreaking such as PAIR can be foiled by simple transformations to the input.

### Question 2 
**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For the quarter 2 project, a potential investigation would be on how to optimize a smoothing algorithm to better defend an LLM. This would help solve a problem at hand, being that jailbreaking is relatively simple and dangerous. Additionally, the Semantic Smoothing has a good amount of problems that we recognized both as a group and as a section.

### Question 3
**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

One potential change I would make in our current approach is focus. As we are planning on doing two different algorithms, being able to correctly and effectively implement both of them is challenging, and I believe that focusing on one topic / algorithm would have allowed for a more robust algorithm and allowed us to test and explore the model more. 

### Question 4
**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I would be interested in utilizing new algorithms to measure success in jailbreaking, similar to JailbreakBench. I believe that although measuring success is an interesting application, and a useful technique to focus on, strengthening a smoothing algorithm is a more important solution on a large scale.
